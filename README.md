### Cat vs. Dog Image Classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

# BRIEF DESCRIPTION

The project aims to implement a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for classifying images of cats and dogs using the Kaggle dataset. SVM is a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. The Kaggle dataset contains thousands of labeled images of cats and dogs, making it suitable for training and testing the SVM model.

*STEPS INVOLVED*
___

## Data Collection: 

Obtain the Kaggle Cats vs. Dogs dataset, which includes a large number of images of cats and dogs. The dataset is typically divided into training and testing sets.

## Data Preprocessing: 

Preprocess the images by resizing them to a uniform size (e.g., 100x100 pixels), converting them to grayscale or RGB channels, and normalizing pixel values. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

## Feature Extraction: 

Extract features from the preprocessed images using techniques like Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) or deep learning-based feature extraction (e.g., using pre-trained convolutional neural networks like VGG, ResNet, etc.).

## Model Training: 

Implement an SVM classifier using a library like scikit-learn in Python. Train the SVM model on the extracted features from the training set, optimizing hyperparameters like the choice of kernel (linear, polynomial, radial basis function) and regularization parameter (C).

## Model Evaluation: 

Evaluate the trained SVM model's performance on the testing set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. Analyze the model's ability to correctly classify images of cats and dogs.

## Fine-Tuning: 

Optionally, perform hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to optimize the SVM model's performance. Experiment with different feature extraction techniques and SVM configurations to improve classification accuracy.

## Prediction: 

Use the trained SVM model to predict the classes (cat or dog) of new unseen images. Evaluate the model's predictions qualitatively by visually inspecting the classification results.

## Visualization: 

Optionally, visualize the SVM decision boundaries, support vectors, and misclassified images to gain insights into the model's behavior and performance.

## Deployment: 

If desired, deploy the trained SVM model as part of a web application or API that can classify images of cats and dogs in real-time.
